# Cisco Networking Labs (Packet Tracer)

This repository contains a collection of **Cisco Packet Tracer (.pkt) lab files** created for learning, practicing, and demonstrating core **computer networking and Cisco routing & switching concepts**.

These labs are suitable for:
- Academic coursework (B.Tech / M.Tech)
- Cisco certification preparation (CCNA-level)
- Hands-on understanding of network behavior

---

##  Repository Structure

Each `.pkt` file represents an **independent networking lab** focusing on a specific concept such as routing, switching, security, or access control.

The labs are designed to be opened and simulated using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

---

##  Lab Descriptions

###  `networktopology.pkt`
- Basic network topology with multiple devices

  - Hop count–based routing decisions

---

###  `vlan.pkt`
- Virtual LAN configuration
- Demonstrates:
  - VLAN creation
  - Access and trunk ports
  - Inter-VLAN communication (if configured)

---

###  `acl.pkt`
- Access Control List (ACL) configuration
- Demonstrates:
